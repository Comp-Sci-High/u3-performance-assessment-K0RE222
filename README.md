Why did you pick this API topic?

I picked this topic because I have a lot of interest in baking.

Describe your API and the available data endpoints

My API can access orders and recipes by using the endpoint /:x/:i, with x being the array that is accessible(makeOrder or recipes), and i being the index you would like to access(0-4). For example, /recipes/0 will send the first index of the recipes array in the object theBakery.

How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?

I feel like I have more insight into a topic I thought was more complicated, but now it seems A LOT simpler.
